# Block files

This folder holds all CSS and JavaScript related to blocks.
More likely than not, it's the folder you need to work in most.

## Structure

- `block-starter`: A starter block folder. Copy this folder to create a new custom block.
- `core`: All modifications to core blocks, including styles.
- `images`: Just like it sounds like. Images go here, webpack processes them.
- `variations`: All block variations go here. A starter block variation is included.

TODO: document the other files in here.
