# WordPress Core Block Styles

This folder is intended for holding styles for all core blocks.
If you're not building a custom theme, you can skip this one.

For frontend developers building custom themes, think of this
set of Sass partials like your handy-dandy checklist. Have you
checked and styled each of these blocks? You probably should.
