# Starter Variation

Variations are an easy way to leverage groups of core or custom blocks
without having to rebuild that functionality yourself.

To start a new block variation, just duplicate `stater-variation.js`
and save it inside this folder.

`index.js` will automatically look for it and include it next time you
run `npm run start`.

If the new variation doesn't appear, please try running `npm cache clear`.
